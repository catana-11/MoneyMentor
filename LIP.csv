Stocks,"Stocks represent ownership shares in a company. When you purchase stock, you’re essentially buying a small portion of the company, and you can benefit from its growth through capital appreciation and dividends. Stocks are traded on stock exchanges like the NYSE or NASDAQ.","Example: If you buy 100 shares of Apple, you own a small fraction of Apple, and you’re entitled to a share of the company’s profits in the form of dividends, if offered.","https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-420,height-315,imgsize-58262,resizemode-75,msid-117306707/markets/stocks/news/ahead-of-market-10-things-that-will-decide-stock-market-action-on-friday.jpg"
Bonds,"Bonds are debt securities issued by companies or governments. When you buy a bond, you’re essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments and the return of the principal amount at maturity. Bonds are considered less risky than stocks but typically offer lower returns.","Example: A U.S. Treasury bond might pay 2% annual interest. If you buy a $1,000 bond, you'll receive $20 per year until the bond matures, at which point you’ll receive your $1,000 principal back.","https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/1QAZGrIk4NP3wLmS0NvrrABupAg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bond-final-f7932c780bc246cbad6c254febe2d0cd.png"
Mutual Funds,"Mutual funds pool money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Investors purchase shares in the fund, and the fund is managed by professionals who allocate the investments across different securities.","Example: A Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund may invest in over 3,000 different U.S. stocks, allowing you to diversify without having to pick individual stocks.","https://zfunds-public.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/articlesImage/1626358916681"
Real Estate,"Real estate investment involves purchasing properties—residential or commercial—with the intention of generating rental income or capital appreciation. Real estate can be a physical investment or via Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) which are traded like stocks.","Example: Buying an apartment and renting it out to tenants provides steady rental income, and the property may appreciate in value over time, giving you a return on your investment.","https://www.thebalancemoney.com/thmb/3EnIaLY-Xlv82gszDtePWOyFK-Y=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/real-estate-what-it-is-and-how-it-works-3305882-1f1ca22206274467862367e2dc59f25b.png"
Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs),"ETFs are similar to mutual funds but are traded on stock exchanges like individual stocks. ETFs typically track indexes, sectors, commodities, or other financial assets, and they allow investors to gain diversified exposure to specific markets with lower fees.","Example: An ETF like the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) tracks the S&P 500 Index and holds shares in companies such as Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, giving you exposure to a wide range of large-cap stocks.","https://m.foolcdn.com/media/dubs/images/etfs-vs-mutual-funds.width-880.png"
Commodities,"Commodities are raw materials or primary agricultural products that can be bought and sold, such as gold, oil, or wheat. Investing in commodities can provide a hedge against inflation or market volatility.","Example: You could invest in gold by buying physical gold bars or through ETFs that track the price of gold, which often rises when other markets fall.","https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/YaiPLQUgOw12scHLa7oevLJQJsI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/commodity-economics-definition-1146936_final-328266ecd48e4a88aa723402cd3ce026.png"
Cryptocurrency,"Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. Cryptocurrencies operate independently of central banks and are decentralized. Bitcoin is the first and most popular cryptocurrency, but there are thousands of others.","Example: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple are some of the most widely known cryptocurrencies. People buy them hoping their value will increase, but they are highly volatile.","https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/3H7VeNxZcl2kaisfTroJGRqFasg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/TermDefinitions_crypto_final-940e93a6cb5341999a5d735fbf04fbfe.png"
Index Funds,"Index funds are a type of mutual fund or ETF that aims to replicate the performance of a specific financial market index, such as the S&P 500. They provide broad market exposure at a low cost.","Example: An index fund like the Vanguard 500 Index Fund invests in the same companies as the S&P 500, providing you with exposure to a broad range of industries and sectors.","https://napkinfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/NapkinFinance-IndexFunds-Napkin-07-20-20-v04.jpg"
High-Yield Savings Accounts,"A high-yield savings account is a deposit account offered by banks and credit unions that pays higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts. They are a low-risk way to save money and earn interest.","Example: If you deposit $5,000 in a high-yield savings account with an interest rate of 1.5%, you’ll earn $75 in interest over the year.","https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/psIcp4BM2pmPZcxQkgFwUEWxZ7U=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/how-to-open-a-high-yield-savings-account-4770631-final-c7f448b5c0bc48658a3c6a4c7afa0a3d.jpg"
Peer-to-Peer Lending,"Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms connect borrowers directly with investors, allowing individuals to lend money to others for personal loans, business loans, or real estate investments.","Example: You might lend money to someone on a platform like LendingClub in exchange for receiving monthly repayments with interest.","https://www.investopedia.com/thmb/epsD3Ryu8lWXh4x2PRzbqv_Jjdo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peer-to-peer-lending.asp-final-ed0306a678e84114801cbb96618d7f4a.png"
